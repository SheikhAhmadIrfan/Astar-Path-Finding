# Star Algorithm

## Description

The Star Algorithm, also known as the A* Algorithm, is a popular pathfinding algorithm used in computer science and artificial intelligence. It efficiently finds the shortest path between two points on a graph or grid while considering obstacles or other constraints. This repository provides an open-source implementation of the A* Algorithm in [programming language of choice].
